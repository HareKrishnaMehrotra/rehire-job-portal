## 🚀 Overview

ReHire is a project close to my heart. It's a job portal designed specifically to help retired professionals find meaningful, flexible work opportunities after retirement. The idea is to bridge the gap between experienced mentors and businesses that need their wisdom.

I built this as my **major individual project** to demonstrate end-to-end full-stack development—from designing a modern, responsive frontend to building robust backend APIs. The goal was to make something *truly helpful*, not just technically sound.
